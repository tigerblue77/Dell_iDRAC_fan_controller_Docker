# time : between two checks the fans stay pinned at FAN_SPEED with Dell's own dynamic fan control
# disabled, so it is also the longest the server can heat up before anything raises them again.
# Past the warning threshold that delay is worth pointing out, past the maximum it stops being a
# configuration choice. Both are only meaningful when the controller actually drives the fans, so

# /!\ This is NOT a limit : detecting more only prints a warning, and every detected CPU is monitored
# whatever its number. Dropping a CPU column would mean silently not watching a heat source, which is
# strictly worse than displaying one CPU too many. It exists so that a count this hardware cannot
# produce -- necessarily a parsing accident -- gets reported instead of passing unnoticed

# a CPU being unable to leave a running machine.
# The cost of waiting is running the Dell default fan control profile a few cycles longer on a server
# that has genuinely lost a CPU; the cost of concluding too early is dropping a socket that was merely
# slow to become readable after POST, and monitoring one heat source less until it shows up again

# server that has no such setting refuses every single time, an iDRAC being reset or a momentary
# network glitch refuses once
