# Highest number of CPUs any Dell PowerEdge has ever had behind a single iDRAC. Chassis products (VRTX,
# FX2, M1000e, MX7000) expose one iDRAC per sled rather than an aggregated one, their CMC not even
# listening on the IPMI port, so this holds for them too.
# /!\ This is NOT a limit : detecting more only prints a warning, and every detected CPU is monitored
# whatever its number. Dropping a CPU column would mean silently not watching a heat source, which is
# strictly worse than displaying one CPU too many. It exists so that a count this hardware cannot
# produce -- necessarily a parsing accident -- gets reported instead of passing unnoticed

# A temperature renders as "NNN°C", i.e. 5 display columns, which every label up to "CPU 9" fits into.
# A CPU column only gets wider than that from a tenth CPU on ("CPU 10"), which no Dell server can have
# and therefore only a mis-parse can produce
